    Support for custom config classes via `config_class:` option (#136 by @solnic)

      ```ruby
      extend Dry::Configurable(config_class: MyConfig)
      ```

      Your config class should inherit from `Dry::Configurable::Config`.

    Return `Dry::Core::Constants::Undefined` (instead of nil) as the value for non-configured settings via a `default_undefined: true` option (#141 by @timriley)

      ```ruby
      extend Dry::Configurable(default_undefined: true)
      ```

      You must opt into this feature via the `default_undefined: true` option. Non-configured setting values are still `nil` by default.

    Improve memory usage by separating setting definitions from config values (#138 by @timriley)

      Your usage of dry-configurable may be impacted if you have been accessing objects from `_settings` or the internals of `Dry::Configurable::Config`. `_settings` now returns `Dry::Configurable::Setting` instances, which contain only the details from the setting's definition. Setting _values_ remain in `Dry::Configurable::Config`.

    The `finalize!` method (as class or instance method, depending on whether you extend or include `Dry::Configurable` respectively) now accepts a boolean `freeze_values:` argument, which if true, will recursively freeze all config values in addition to the `config` itself. (#105 by @ojab)

      ```ruby
      class MyConfigurable
        include Dry::Configurable

        setting :db, default: "postgre"
      end

      my_obj = MyConfigurable.new

    `Dry::Configurable::Config#update` will set hashes as values for non-nested settings (#131 by @ojab)

        setting :sslcert, constructor: ->(v) { v&.values_at(:pem, :pass)&.join }
      end

      MyConfigurable.config.update(sslcert: {pem: "cert", pass: "qwerty"})
      MyConfigurable.config.sslcert # => "certqwerty"

  - Changes to config values in parent classes after subclasses have already been
    created will not be propogated to those subclasses. Subclasses created _after_

    Only `#initialize` instance method is prepended, leaving the rest of the instance
    methods to be included as normal again. This allows classes including
    `Dry::Configurable` to override instance methods with their own methods as required
    (@adam12 in #103)
  added:
  - |-
    Settings may be specified with a `cloneable` option, e.g.

    ```ruby
    setting :component_dirs, Configuration::ComponentDirs.new, cloneable: true
    ```

    This change makes it possible to provide “rich” config values that carry their own
    configuration interface.

    In the above example, `ComponentDirs` could provide its own API for adding component
    dirs and configuring aspects of their behavior at the same time. By being passed to
    the setting along with `cloneable: true`, dry-configurable will ensure the setting's
    values are cloned along with the setting at all the appropriate times.

    A custom cloneable setting value should provide its own `#initialize_copy` (used by
    `Object#dup`) with the appropriate logic. (@timriley in #102)
